###Open a tODE client image

Once you have installed the server and tODE client, you can open the tODE client and start using it.

On the client node, execute:
```
startClient <clientName>
```

Use the name of the client you created.  These instructions have used the client name **tode1**, in which case you can executs

```
startClient tode1
```

The script `clients` will list all installed clients.

The image looks like this:

![tode image][2]


####Open a tODE shell
Once a tode client image is open, use the following menu to open a tode shell:  
   
![open tode shell][1]

*If an error occurs while attempting to open the tODE shell, try a 
![tODE Test Login][4] 
to get more information for diagnosing the problem.*

####Open a tODE project list

Open a tODE a *Project List Browser* using the `project list` tODE command:

![project list][3]
