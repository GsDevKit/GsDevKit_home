## Introduction

---

**READ THE INSTALL GUIDES for [Linux][1] or [Mac][2] FIRST**.

---

The upgrade process can get a little complicated, so I have created an
[upgradeGemStone script][3] that acts as a driver for the entire GsDevKitHome upgrade
process.

To perform an upgrade, you need to accomplish three things:

1. Install the GemStone/S Core code base for the target GemStone version, which may include new **Global** methods and classes.


2. Install the GLASS/GsDevKit code base for the target GemStone version, which may include different sets of GsDevKit packages.

3. Install your application code, which may need to be different for the target GemStone version.

During the upgrade process, all methods are removed from the  classes in GemStone, so it is necessary to reload the  GLASS/GsDevKit and you application code.

The [upgradeGemStone script][3] automates nearly all of the upgrade steps called out in the [Upgrading from GemStone/S 64 Bit 3.x versions][20] chapter: [step 1][13], [step 4][21], [step 5][22] and [step 6][23] of the [Prepare for Upgrade][7] section; [step 1][8] and [step 2][10] of the [Perform the Upgrade][9] section. All of the steps in the [Upgrading GsDevKit Applications][15]

[Steo 2][14] and [step 3][16] of the [Prepare for Upgran][7] section need to be performed manually before the upgrade is started.

[Step 3][11], and [step 4][12] of the [Perform the Upgrade][9] section need to be performed manually after the upgrade is comnplete).

## Porting your application to the target version of GemStone

---

**READ THE INSTALL GUIDES for [Linux][1] or [Mac][2] FIRST**.

---

As part of the upgrade process, you need to port your application code to
the target GemStone version and verify that the application code itself works well in
that version of GemStone.

If you are upgrading from GemStone 3.1.x the port may be no more
complicated than installing your application in a virgin seaside extent
and running your tests.

If you are upgrading from GemStone 2.x, the port may be more complicated
and you should pay special attention to the section entitled
[Prior to Upgrade in existing application][18] in [Chapter 3][17] of the
Install Guides.

You should also [Check for use of deprecated methods][19].

### Package Naming Guidelines

If you find that you do indeed have code changes that are specific to
the target version of GemStone, then you will need to decide on a re-packaging strategy. You can
take one of two routes:

1. Create a package branch using the GemStone version number (`3.2` for example), where you simply make the necessary
   changes for `3.2` in-place and then save the Monticello package,
   with a branch name. The package named *MyApplication-Core* would be
   saved as *MyApplication-Core.v32* and your configuration baseline
   would look like the following:

   ```Smalltalk
   spec for: #'gemstone' do: [
     spec package: 'MyApplication-Core' ].
   spec for: #'gs3.2.x' do: [
     spec package: 'MyApplication-Core' with: [ spec file: 'MyApplication-Core.v32']
   ```

2. Separate the code into a common package, a `2.x` package, and a `3.2`
   package. The *MyApplication-Core* package would become the common package.
   The methods and classes that are unique to `2.x` would be be moved into
   a package named *MyApplication-2x-Core*. The methods and classes
   that are unique to `3.2` would be be moved into a package named  
   *MyApplication-32x-Core*. Your configuration baseline would be
   modified to look like the following:

   ```Smalltalk
   spec for: #'gemstone' do: [
     spec package: 'MyApplication-Core' ].
   spec
     for: #'gs2.4.x'
     do: [
       spec
         package: 'MyApplication-Core'
           with: [ spec includes: 'MyApplication-2x-Core' ];
         package: 'MyApplication-2x-Core'
           with: [ spec requires: 'MyApplication-Core' ] ].
   spec
     for: #'gs3.2.x'
     do: [
       spec
         package: 'MyApplication-Core'
           with: [ spec includes: 'MyApplication-32-Core' ];
         package: 'MyApplication-32-Core'
           with: [ spec requires: 'MyApplication-Core' ] ]
   ```

The first approach is appropriate if you will be moving your entire
development effort to GemStone 3.2 and most if not all code
modifications will take place in the 3.2 branch. It is relatively easy
to merge changes from *MyApplication-Core* to *MyApplication-Core.v32*,
but it is not quite as easy to merge changes from *MyApplication-Core.v32*
back to *MyApplication-Core*.

The second approach is appropriate if you intend to continue development
for both GemStone `2.x` (or `3.1.x`) and GemStone `3.2` as it is much easier
to share the common code across multiple platforms, when merging
isn't required.

## Pre Upgrade

---

**READ THE INSTALL GUIDES for [Linux][1] or [Mac][2] FIRST**.

---

Before running the [upgradeGemStone script][3] for the first time, you need to
[reset SystemUser password][14] and [stop user activity][16].

## Running the upgradeGemStone script

---

**READ THE INSTALL GUIDES for [Linux][1] or [Mac][2] FIRST**.

---

The [upgradeGemStone script][3] performs the following upgrade steps:

1. [Install and configure the target version of GemStone](#1-install-and-configure-the-target-version-of-gemstone)
2. [Stop source stone](#2-stop-source-stone)
3. [Set up the target stone environment](#3-set-up-the-target-stone-environment)
4. [Copy extent and remove tranlog files](#4-copy-extent-and-remove-tranlog-files)
5. [Start target stone](#5-start-stone)
6. [Run  `$GEMSTONE/bin/upgradeImage` script](#6-run-gemstonebinupgradeimage-script)
7. [Configure the GsDevKit Upgrade](#7-configure-the-gsdevkit-upgrade)
8. [Run *upgradeSeasideImage* script](#5-run-upgradeseasideimage-script)
9. [Execute *application-load* topaz file](#6-execute-application-load-topaz-file)

---

### 1. Install and configure the target version of GemStone
[Step 1][13] of the [Prepare for Upgrade][7] section is performed using the [installGemStone][24] and [createStone][25] scripts.

### 2. Stop source stone
[Step 4][21] of the [Prepare for Upgrade][7] section is performed using the [stopStone][26] script.

### 3. Set up the target version environment
[Step 5][22]  of the [Prepare for Upgrade][7] section is performed by the [createStone][25] script, setting up the standard GsDevKitHome environment. The [upgradeGemStone script][3] creates an `upgradeLog` directory in the `$GS_HOME/gemstone/stones/<target-stone-name>` directory and devinds the `upgradeLogDir` environment variable.

### 4. Copy extent and remove tranlog files
[step 6][23] of the [Prepare for Upgrade][7] section is performed by the [stoneNewExtent][27] script.

### 5. Start stone
[Step 1][8] of the [Perform the Upgrade][9] section is performed by the [startStone][28] script. If the source stone is a 2.4.x version, then the `-C` option is used to start the stone.

### 6. Run `$GEMSTONE/bin/upgradeImage` script
Once the stone has been started, the script runs *upgradeImage*
using the following command:

```Shell
$GEMSTONE/bin/upgradeImage -s $GEMSTONE_NAME
```
If there are errors during the exectuion of the script,
the *topazerrors.log* file contains pointers to the error conditions. See
[Interpretting topazerrors.log files](#interpretting-topazerrorslog-files)
for information about interpretting the contents of the *topazerrors.log*.

### 7. Configure the GsDevKit Upgrade

### 5. Run *upgradeSeasideImage* script
Once the *bootstrap-globals* script has been run, the *upgradeSeaside* script is run using the following command:

```Shell
$GEMSTONE/seaside/bin/upgradeSeasideImage -s $GEMSTONE_NAME
```
If there are errors during the exectuion of the script,
the *topazerrors.log* file contains pointers to the error conditions. See
[Interpretting topazerrors.log files](#interpretting-topazerrorslog-files)
for information about interpretting the contents of the *topazerrors.log*.

### 6. Execute *application-load* topaz file
As the final operation in this script, the specified *application-load* topaz script
is executed. The *application-load* file is specified by the `-a` option:

```Shell
$WE_HOME/bin/upgrade.sh -C -e /opt/gemstone/3.1/product/seaside/data/extent0.dbf \
                        -a $WE_HOME/bin/upgrade/loadSeaside3.0.10.tpz \
                        -b $WE_HOME/bin/upgrade/bootstrapConfigurationOf
```

In the above example, the file [$WE_HOME/bin/upgrade/loadSeaside3.0.10.tpz](../../bin/upgrade/loadSeaside3.0.10.tpz)
is specified, but this file along with the other *load* files in the directory:

- [loadGLASS1.tpz](../../bin/upgrade/[loadGLASS1.tpz)
- [loadSeaside3.0.10.tpz](../../bin/upgrade/loadSeaside3.0.10.tpz)
- [loadSeaside3.1.0.tpz](../../bin/upgrade/loadSeaside3.1.0.tpz)

are simply example scripts. To create your own *application-load* file, you should take the topaz script
that you use to load your code into GemStone/S and modify it so that it will perform as an *application-load*
script. To do so, you need to add a **MCPerformPostloadNotification** handler to your load script and
only allow the initialization of classes that are needed for the upgrade. The following code can be
used as a template:

```Smalltalk
| performInitialization |
performInitialization := #("names of class needing class initialization during upgrade").
[
"<...your application load code...>"
] on: MCPerformPostloadNotification do: [:ex |
           (performInitialization includes: ex postloadClass theNonMetaClass name)
             ifTrue: [
               "perform initialization"
               ex resume: true ]
             ifFalse: [
               GsFile gciLogServer: ' Skip ', ex postloadClass name asString, ' initialization.'.
                ex resume: false ] ]
```

During the upgrade process, all of the methods are removed from your application classes, so during the load,
*Monticello* will rerun **all** class initializations. Obviously, this can lead to all sorts of nasty problems.

99% of the classes do not need to have the class initaliazations run, however, every once in a while, you may
find it necessary to run an #initialize method. If you look at the *upgradeSeasideImage* script there are a handful
of classes that are explicitly initialized during upgrade.

If there are errors during the exectuion of the script,
the *topazerrors.log* file contains pointers to the error conditions. See
[Interpretting topazerrors.log files](#interpretting-topazerrorslog-files)
for information about interpretting the contents of the *topazerrors.log*.

## Post Upgrade

---

**READ THE INSTALL GUIDES for [Linux][1] or [Mac][2] FIRST**.

---

After the script has completed with no errors, you should continue following
the upgrade procedure outlined in the *Post-upgrade Application Code Modifications*
sections in **Chapter 2. Upgrading from previous
GemStone/S 64 Bit 3.x versions** or **Chapter 3. Converting from GemStone/S 64 Bit 2.4.xversions** of the
[Linux][1] or [Mac][2] **Install Guides**.

## Upgrade Error Diagnostics

### Common *upgradeImage* Errors
If an error occurs while running *upgradeImage*
it will more than likely require help from GemStone engineers to
diagnose the problem.

Gather up the log files and package them in an email to the [GLASS mailing
list][5].

### Common *upgradeSeasideImage* Errors
The most common *upgradeSeasideImage* occurs when an mcz file is not
found in the **BootstrapRepositoryDirectory** (`$GEMSTONE/seaside/monticello/repository` by default):

```
GemStone: Error         Nonfatal

```

The best way to resolve the error is to find a copy of the missing mcz
file (*Squeak.v32-dkh.300.mcz* or *OB-GemStone-Platform-dkh.69*) and copy it into
the **BootstrapRepositoryDirectory**. If you are
using the default location, you will need to make the directory
writable.

### Interpretting *topazerrors.log* files
If an error occurs while running a topaz script, a *topazerrors.log* is
created containing pointers to the line number of path to the topaz log
file. Here's an example *topazerrors.log* file:

```
near line 110 of file /export/foos2/users/dhenrich/3.0/n_gss64bit/upgrades/upgradeDir/topazApplication_1.out, ERROR: UNEXPECTED ERROR
topaz> time
 04/23/2014 14:10:46.634 PDT
```

It is worth noting that for the topaz upgrade scripts uses both the
`stk` and `stack` arguments for the `iferr` command:

```
iferr 1 stk
iferr 2 stack
```

The `stk` argument means that the stack trace is dumped to the log file
with a single line per frame (i.e., no argument or temp values) like the
following:

```
 ==> 1 MessageNotUnderstood >> defaultAction         @2 line 3   [methId 212055297]
 2 MessageNotUnderstood (AbstractException) >> _signalWith: @5 line 25   [methId 21212    0321]
 3 MessageNotUnderstood (AbstractException) >> signal @2 line 47   [methId 212123905]
 4 UndefinedObject (Object) >> doesNotUnderstand: @9 line 10   [methId 168907521]
 5 UndefinedObject (Object) >> _doesNotUnderstand:args:envId:reason: @7 line 12   [met    hId 168899073]
 6 [] in  ExecBlock0 (MetacelloScriptEngine) >> get @13 line 12   [methId 241598209]
 ...
```

The second `stack` argument means that after the `stk` display, a second
listing of the stack is dumped to the log file that includes arguments
and temp values:

```
