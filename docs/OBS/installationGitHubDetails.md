This document provides detailed step-by-step instructions on forking GsDevKit, cloning to
your local server, creating a branch, and how to commit and update.  

Github and git provide many options and this is not the only way to perform these tasks; these instructions
are provided as a convenience for people getting started with github.

### Log into your github account
[log in to github][1].  
If you don't have a github account, you can create a free account here: [join github][2].

### Fork the GsDevKit project on github.
[Fork the GsDevKit project] [4] to your account.  

### Setup your SSH credentials
When you clone a git repository, your remote repository credentials (i.e., GitHub username and password) are needed for doing commands like push.

It is strongly recommended to use SSH and setup an [SSH keypair][5]. With an SSH keypair, you are not prompted for a username and password, so git interactions are simplified. You can also use [SSH agent forwarding][6] to use your local SSH keys for server installations.

It is also possible to clone using https://github.com/GsDevKit/gsDevKitHome.git; you may need to do this, for example, if your firewall prevents the use of SSH. This creates problems with the tODE development environment, which invokes git using non-interactive performOnServer:. In this case, you will need to set up a [credential.helper for git][7], and you you should probably also use `git-credential-store, which stores credentials in a file on disk protected by filesystem permissions.


##Clone your GsDevKit fork
On your local GemStone development server, clone your GsDevKit fork.

```Shell
git clone git@github.com:<yourAccountName>/gsDevKitHome.git  
```

## Create a branch for your work
You will create a unique branch for your work, to keep your in-progress work separate from your main codebase.  You may create several branches that you can merge into your fork when they are ready.

```Shell
cd gsDevKitHome
git checkout -b  <your_branch_name>
```

To ensure that this branch is visible on github, perform the synchronization:
```
git push origin <your_branch_name>
```  

### Set your default branch
On your github settings page, (https://github.com/<yourAccountName>/gsDevKitHome/settings), set the default branch for your account to your new branch.

### Work on your code
You are now ready to work on code!  

These instructions do not cover all you need to know about using git for managing code, but a few tips:

To commit changes in your local checkout to the github branch:
```
git commit -a -m "checkin comment"
git push origin <your_branch_name>
```
To update your local checkout from the github branch:
```
git pull origin <your_branch_name>
```
