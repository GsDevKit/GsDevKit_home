# Name - upgradeImage
# Installed as - upgradeImage
#
# Purpose - 
#
# This script does a fresh filein of all the kernel classes.
# The filein of the GemStone/S 64 kernel classes will wipe out all the existing 
# methods in kernel classes. Therefore, if users have added methods to 
# kernel classes, they should file them out before running this script. 
# After this  script has been run, those methods should be filed in again.
#
# Requirements:
# 
# The following environment variables should be set: 
#	GEMSTONE 	- set to the GemStone/S 64 product tree.
#       upgradeLogDir   - a writable scratch directory.
#       GEMSTONE_SYS_CONF - 
#
# CUSTOMER UPGRADE PROCEDURE
#   Please refer to the GemStone/S 64 Bit 3.x Installation Guide and/or
#   release notes for detailed instructions.

Starting GemStone/S 64 3.x kernel class filein.

Note: All user defined changes and additions to kernel classes will be
removed. It is therefore advised that all such changes be filed out before
starting conversion and filed back in after conversion is complete. Layered
products which change the kernel classes, such as GemConnect, will also lose
the changes. All such products must be reinstalled following the upgrade.

Stone name is $stoneName.
