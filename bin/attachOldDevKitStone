USAGE: $(basename $0) [-h] [-t] [-o <old-stone-name] ( -d | -m ) <stone-name> <gemstone-version> <old-GS_HOME-path>

Attach to a stone that was created using GsDevKit/gsDevKitHome. When you attach
to a gsDevKitHome stone, a symbolic link is created from 
\$GS_SERVER_STONES/<stone-name> to the original directory where your stone was
created. Then the session description for the stone is copied into the 
\$GS_SHARED_SESSIONS directory so that GsDevKit_home clients can connect to
stone.

All of the standard stone control scripts can be used against the stone.

If the -t option is specified, the stone is assumed to have tODE installed and
tODE directory structure (home and projects) is copied to \$GS_TODE/sys 
directory structure.

If the -m option is specified, then the stone was created using the "master 
branch" of gsDevKitHome (v0.0.4 or earlier).

If the -d option is specified, then the stone was created using the "dev branch"
of gsDevKitHome (v0.1.0 or earlier). 

You are using the "dev branch" if the directory \$GS_HOME does not exist.  You 
are using the "master branch" if the directory \$GS_HOME/tode/home exists.
