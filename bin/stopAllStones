USAGE: $(basename $0) [-h] <args...>

Stop all stones. Any statmonitor processes associated with the stones will be stopped as well.

The netldi for the stones are left running unless the -b option is specified.

This scripts allows all same arguments as specified in stopStone, and these arguments are directly passed to such a script for each stone.

If the stone or netldi was started with a different Operatying System user than the one running GsDevKit_Home,
then such a user must be defined in the variable GS_OS_USER in the custom_stone.env file of the stone. For example:

export GS_OS_USER="osUser"

If GS_OS_USER is defined, then the stop of the netldi and stone will require sudo permission to do the su to the given user.
To get this sudo permission, this script must be called with the root user or else using sudo but making sure to presever environment variables
with the -E argument. For example:

sudo -E $GS_HOME/bin/stopAllStones

Note that we assume that the sudo user does have GS_HOME correctly set prior to this call.
