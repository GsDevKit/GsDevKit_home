# Open Source Development Kit for GemStone/S 64 Bit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GsDevKit/GsDevKit_home.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GsDevKit/GsDevKit_home)

The Development Kit for GemStone/S (GsDevKit) contains tools and compatiblity changes that sit on top of the GemStone/S 64 Bit product, providing a complete and powerful open-source development environment. The Development kit allows Smalltalk developers to take advantage of GemStone's object persistence, along with a variety of open-source Smalltalk tools and frameworks.

GsDevKit is a client-server system, which may both be installed on a single machine, or the server and client may be installed on separate nodes. The GsDevKit server installation includes the GemStone/S server.
